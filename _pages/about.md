I am a Research Professor at the Climate Physics Laboratory (led by Prof. Chang-Hoi Ho) at Ewha Womans University in Seoul, South Korea. My research aims to understand and predict tropical cyclones across multiple timescales, from their role in the long-term climate system to their immediate weather impacts.

My primary research areas include:

- TC life cycle: Climatology, genesis, and extratropical transition.
- TC impacts: Influence on regional rainfall distribution and air quality, and the occurrence of heat extremes.
- TC forecasting: Developing novel deep learning models for track prediction.

To address these complex topics, my approach integrates reanalysis and model outputs, numerical modeling, and the development of advanced machine learning models.
