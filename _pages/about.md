I am a Postdoctoral Researcher in Climate Physics Laboratory (led by Prof. Chang-Hoi Ho) at Ewha Womans University, South Korea. My researches are related to <b>tropical cyclones</b>: climatology, extratropical transition, genesis, their impact on regional air quality, and medium-range track forecast. Through these wide-ranging topics which encompass long-term future climate to short-term weather time-scale, I acquire diverse experience including analyzing large reanalysis datasets and weather forecast/climate model output, running numerical models, and developing deep learning model.

In additional to tropical cyclones, I am also interested in the understanding of the changes in <b>East Asian climate systems</b> and the application of <b>machine learning methods</b> on atmospheric sciences, which are both my future research directions.
