I am a postdoctoral researcher in the group <a href="https://cityusee.wixsite.com/climate-extreme" target="_blank">Climate Extreme Laboratory</a> (led by Prof. Jung-Eun Chu) at City University of Hong Kong. My researches are related to <b>tropical cyclones</b>: medium-range track forecast, climatology, extratropical transition, genesis, and their impact on regional air quality. Through these wide-ranging topics, I acquire diverse experience including developing deep learning model, running numerical models (WRF and CMAQ), and analyzing large reanalysis datasets and weather forecast/climate model output.

In additional to tropical cyclones, I am also interested in the application of machine learning methods on atmospheric sciences, and understanding East Asian climate system, which are both my future research directions.
