I am a Postdoctoral Researcher in Climate Physics Laboratory (led by Prof. Chang-Hoi Ho) at Ewha Womans University, South Korea. My work focuses on several aspects of <b>tropical cyclones</b>, including their climatology, extratropical transition, genesis, impact on regional air quality, and medium-range track forecast. Through these wide-ranging topics, which encompass long-term future climate to short-term weather time-scale, I have acquired diverse experience including analyzing large reanalysis datasets and weather forecast/climate model output, running numerical models, and developing deep learning models.

Beyond tropical cyclones, I am also interested in the understanding of the changes in <b>East Asian climate systems</b> and the application of <b>machine learning methods</b> to atmospheric sciences, which are both my future research directions.
