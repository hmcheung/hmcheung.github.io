I am a Postdoctoral Researcher in Climate Physics Laboratory (led by Prof. Chang-Hoi Ho) at Ewha Womans University, South Korea. My work encompasses a wide range of topics, from the long-term future climate to short-term weather time-scale. This includes the climatology of <b>tropical cyclones</b>, their extratropical transition, genesis, impact on regional air quality, and medium-range track forecast. Through this work, I have gained diverse experience in analyzing large datasets, running numerical models, and developing deep learning models.

Beyond tropical cyclones, I am also interested in the understanding of the changes in <b>East Asian climate systems</b> and the application of <b>machine learning methods</b> to atmospheric sciences, which are both my future research directions.
