I am a postdoctoral researcher in the group <a href="https://cityusee.wixsite.com/climate-extreme" target="_blank">Climate Extreme Laboratory</a> (led by Prof. Jung-Eun Chu) at City University of Hong Kong. My research topics are related to <b>tropical cyclones</b>: medium-range track forecast, climatology, extratropical transition, genesis, and impact on regional air quality.
