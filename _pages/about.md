I am a Research Professor in the group Climate Physics Laboratory (led by Prof. Chang-Hoi Ho) at Ewha Womans University, South Korea. My researches are related to <b>tropical cyclones</b>: medium-range track forecast, climatology, extratropical transition, genesis, and their impact on regional air quality. Through these wide-ranging topics which encompass short-term weather to long-term future climate time-scale, I acquire diverse experience including developing deep learning model, running numerical models, and analyzing large reanalysis datasets and weather forecast/climate model output.

In additional to tropical cyclones, I am also interested in the application of <b>machine learning methods</b> on atmospheric sciences, and understanding the changes in <b>East Asian climate systems</b>, which are both my future research directions.
