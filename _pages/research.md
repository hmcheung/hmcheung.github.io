My research mainly focuses on the track forecast and the impacts of tropical cyclones (TCs).

## Machine learning models for tropical cyclone track forecast

Physical models have long been the tool for making weather forecasts. Owing to the advancement of computer resources, machine learning algorithms for weather forecast has gained popularity in recent years. During my PhD, I developed two machine learning models for improving TC track forecast in the medium range (>5 days). 

The first model (track-pattern-based model)Â applies a clustering method on historical TC tracks similar to an operational forecast track; makes predictions based on each track pattern; and combines the forecast for each track pattern to form the final forecast. The second model uses different classes of artificial neural networks in concert to correct the TC track predicted by a US global weather forecast model (GEFS). The neural network model is improved by including a shortcut connection, feature selection, and hyperparameter tuning.

## Regional impacts of tropical cyclones

<ins>TC rainfall and East Asian Summer Monsoon (EASM)</ins>

In addition to the EASM, TCs are another major contributor to summer rainfall over East Asia, especially for the coastal region. This study analyzes the contribution of TCs to summer rainfall in the years of strong versus weak Changma/Baiu, which is the monsoon season in Korea/Japan.

<ins>Air pollution and TC track change</ins>

Various studies have confirmed that a TC at a distance from Hong Kong can create conducive conditions for regional air pollutant episodes (light northerly for pollutant transport, subsidence unfavorable for pollutant dispersion, and increased air temperature for ozone formation). Our study further verifies the impact of TCs on local air quality on a climate scale by investigating the influence of the change in the prevailing TC track over the western North Pacific.

## An end of tropical cyclones: extratropical transition

When TCs move to the mid-latitudes, they oftentimes undergo extratropical transition (ET) by which they change their structure. Upon transforming into extratropical cyclones (ETCs), they tend to impact larger areas and thus larger populations. In our study, we used a state-of-the-art Earth system model to examine the changes in global ET activities under increased concentrations (doubling and quadrupling) of CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere. Our study highlights the possibility of a heightened impact from the transitioned TCs in the mid-latitude region due to human-induced global warming.
