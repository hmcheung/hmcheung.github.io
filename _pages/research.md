My research mainly focuses on the track forecast and the impacts of tropical cyclones (TCs).

## Machine learning models for tropical cyclone track forecast

---

Physical models have long been the tool for making weather forecasts. Owing to the advancement of computer resources, machine learning algorithms for weather forecast has gained popularity in recent years. During my PhD, I developed two machine learning models for improving TC track forecast in the medium range (>5 days). 

<br>In the first study, I developed a track-pattern-based model:Â applying a clustering method on historical TC tracks similar to an operational forecast track; making predictions based on each track pattern; and combining the forecast for each track pattern to form the final forecast.

<br>In the second study,
